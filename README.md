# Recommender-System-for-User-User-Ratings

To use the code, change the globals listed under 'MAIN' in 'recommender.py'. 

#  Globals 
gammaG = 2     | The normalizing factor used in the sigmoid normalizing function

aG = 1         | Active user we a recommending users to

maxNG = 40     | Maximum number of user neighbours to be used during the computation

sG = 10        | The top s predictions will be printed

GCG = 0        | The graph cutoff, won't show values less than GCG

# Notes

All of the code was written by myself and all credit for the improvements made to the existing model goes to me.
